Nodal Density in Penile Cancer
=================

### Description
This repository contains the data analysis and results of evaluating the usefulness of inguinal nodal density as a predictor of aggressive pathologic features and outcome in patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The repository contains the following files, pages, and folders:

* [Results:](https://github.com/alcideschaux/PenisNodalDensity/blob/master/MexicanPenile.md) This page contains the results of the analysis.
* [Codebook:](https://github.com/alcideschaux/PenisNodalDensity/blob/master/CodeBook.md) This page contains the description of the variables with labels and levels.
* [Dataset:](https://github.com/alcideschaux/PenisNodalDensity/blob/master/mx_penile_dataset_february_2014.dta) This file corresponds to the dataset that it was used for analysis, in .dta format.
* [Figures:](https://github.com/alcideschaux/PenisNodalDensity/tree/master/figure) This folder contains the plots generated by the analysis in PNG format.
* [R code:](https://github.com/alcideschaux/PenisNodalDensity/blob/master/MexicanPenile.Rmd) This file contains the R code that was used for analysis.

### Aim
The aim of this project is to evaluate the association of nodal density (defined as the ratio of metastatic inguinal lymph nodes over the total number of inguinal lymph nodes removed) with clinicopathologic features and outcome in patients with invasive penile SCC.
